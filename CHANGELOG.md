- Fixed the issue where nil for header_ids by @ppworks in https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker/pull/324

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/gjtorikian/commonmarker/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1

# [v2.0.0] - 25-11-2024

This is a major release in the sense that there's a breaking API change,
but not in the sense that anything earth-shatteringly urgent has
occurred.

In certain situations, user-provided options were not being merged
correctly. This meant that default config values were being ignored
erroneously.
This was a bug, which has been fixed. Unfortunately, it's possible that
downstream projects were relying on the old, broken behavior, so a
simple patch release wouldn't do.

If you're _not_ passing any options to `to_html` and everything works
fine for you, than this should be an upgrade without side-effects.

If you _are_ passing options to `to_html` (i.e. overridding the
defaults), then consult the README for a list of options and
their default values. Make sure that the default values given to
`to_html` is acceptable to your project!

As an example of the change here, `extension: { header_ids }` is
set to `""`, which means that `h*` tags will have GitHub style
anchors automatically added to them. You can remove this (and other
undesired options) by passing a `nil` value: `extension: { header_ids: nil }`.
